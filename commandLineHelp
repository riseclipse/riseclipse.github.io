       files ending with ".nsd" are considered NS files,
       files ending with ".snsd" are considered ServiceNS files,
       files ending with ".AppNS" are considered ApplicableServiceNS files (at most one should be given),
       files ending with ".nsdoc" are considered NSDoc files,
       case is ignored for all these extensions,

   The following options are recognized:
        --verbose
        --info

        --make-explicit-links

            Only errors detected in NSD files are displayed by default. This option allows for other messages to be displayed (according to the chosen level).
