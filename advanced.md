## Using RiseClipse plugins in Eclipse

RiseClipse plugins can be added to an existing Eclipse installation using [this update site](https://github.com/riseclipse/riseclipse-distribution/releases/download/latest/).

This opens the following possibilities:
* use the RiseClipse editor to explore and navigate models (SCL, NSD and CIM files)
* directly validate such model with OCL constraints (either loaded from a file or written 
in the editor)
* write OCL constraints using the assisted editor

An old step-by-step guide was written for setting up an environment when there was no update site, it refers to an old version of Eclipse but may still be useful. It is available [online](ocl_contribution_for_scl_guide) or as 
[PDF](downloads/RiseClipse_Guide_installation_and_OCL.pdf)
