# RiseClipse: using MDE tools for IEC standards

## RiseClipse summary

RiseClipse is an umbrella name for tools based on MDE technologies and dedicated to IEC standards. Open source RiseClipse components are availble under the EPL version 2.0. 

The main use of RiseClipse is to validate IEC CIM files and IEC 61850 SCL configuration files : data described in these files are loaded in a way to become conformant with an UML model (either the CIM UML model or the SCL one), and OCL is used for validation. Therefore, the validation is not only done at the syntactic level but also at the semantic one.
