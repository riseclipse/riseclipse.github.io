## Using RiseClipse plugins in Eclipse

RiseClipse plugins can be used with Eclipse 2019-06 (the support of newer versions is WIP).

This opens the following possibilities:
* use the RiseClipse editor to explore and navigate models (SCL, NSD and CIM files)
* directly validate such model with OCL constraints (either loaded from a file or written 
in the editor)
* write OCL constraints using the assisted editor

A step-by-step guide for setting up an environment allowing:
* the navigation in SCL and NSD models,
* the use of OCL console,
* the contribution of OCL rules for SCL

has been written, it is available [online](ocl_contribution_for_scl_guide) or as 
[PDF](downloads/RiseClipse_Guide_installation_and_OCL.pdf)
